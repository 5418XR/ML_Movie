## Introduction

Welcome to this GitHub repository! This project utilizes the latest GPT-4 model from OpenAI to generate high-quality datasets, focusing on detailed descriptions of each frame in movie scenes, including the structure of the scene, camera angles, actors, emotions, and plot elements.

## Important Updates

- **Adoption of the New GPT-4 Model:** We've shifted to the newly released GPT-4 model by OpenAI, resulting in significant improvements in the quality of our datasets.
- **Code Updates:** All related codes for dataset generation have been updated and are now centralized in `man.py`.
- **Discontinuation of Previous Installation and Setup Processes:** We are in the process of revising our installation guidelines.

## Accessing Dataset and Models

If you wish to access our dataset and the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model, please visit our [Hugging Face repository](#). (Replace `#` with the actual URL to your Hugging Face repository)

## Installation Instructions

The new installation guide is currently being developed. Depending on your computer's environment, you may need to add various database dependencies. We will provide a detailed installation and configuration guide as soon as possible.

## Dataset Changes

- **Discontinuation of MovieNet Database:** We've completely abandoned the MovieNet database as the datasets generated with the GPT-4 model are far superior in clarity and accuracy.
- **Improved Clarity and Accuracy:** The data generated by the GPT-4 model is not only clearer but also more precise in descriptions.

## Branch Information

- **Demo Branch:** You can view the old code in the Demo Branch.
- **Main Branch:** The new version of the code will be continuously refined and iterated in the Main Branch.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed (installation guide is being updated).
3. Run `man.py` to generate the dataset as per the instructions.
